# GJR-GARCH
  Fitting a GJR GARCH model on NIFTY 50 returns (2015-2026) to study the leverage effect firsthand.

## Overview
  Upon fitting a plain GARCH(1,1) model on 11 years of NIFTY 50 log returns in a previous repository, it was observed that a Ljung-Box test carried out on the model showed leftover ARCH effects. The null hypothesis of no autocorrelation was rejected and it was confirmed that there remained volatility clustering in the model even after fitting. This was due to the modeled assumption of the GARCH(1,1) model which assumes negative and positive shock have symmetric effects on volatility. The preceding assumption has been well recorded as an oversimplification due to the leverage effect which states that negative shocks raise uncertainty in markets which leads to an increase in trading volume and therefore volatility in markets on a greater scale than positive shocks of the same size. In order to capture the leverage effect, the GJR GARCH model is utilized due to the presence of the Gamma parameter which measures how much excess volatility response is triggered as a consequence of negative shocks.

## Data and Methodology
  As stated and explained in the [GARCH (1,1) repository](https://github.com/uzair1509/GARCH_1_1), logarithmic returns are calculated from NIFTY 50 close prices of the past 11 years (2015-2026) for their time additivity effects. First, a plain GARCH(1,1) model is fit to act as control. Then three GJR GARCH models are fit on the log returns with Alpha, Beta, and Gamma lags being set at 1 and standardized residuals assumed to follow Student's t-distribution in one model, skewed-t distribution in the second model, and normal distribution in the last model. 
  
  The Alpha, Beta, and Gamma values are calculated for all the GJR models and shock persistence is calculated. Using the persistence values the shock half life is calculated for the models. The GJR persistence formula differs here with Gamma being a contributor to persistence:
  $$\text{Persistence} = \alpha + \beta + \frac{\gamma}{2}$$

  The Gamma term is divided by 2 here based on the assumption that negative and positive shocks in the market have the same occurrence probability. Since we assume half the days do not have a negative shock this means that on half of the days the gamma coefficient is zero (only 1 when shock is negative) hence Gamma's contribution is roughly half its value in the persistence formula.
  
  Moreoever, utilizing the conditional volatility of the models, standardized residuals are calculated using the formula: 
  
  $$z_t = \frac{\varepsilon_t}{\sigma_t}$$
  ```
standardised residuals = residuals / conditional volatility
  ```
  Once standardised residuals are calculated the Ljung-Box test can now be carried out using squared standardised residuals and the ARCH LM test using standardised residuals to allow for valid comparison between the models. Moreover, AIC and BIC are calculated for all models to compare goodness of fit, following the same procedure as the [GARCH (1,1) repository](https://github.com/uzair1509/GARCH_1_1).\

  ## Results

  The following results were obtained after all tests including the residual diagnostics were run,

| Model | α | β | γ | AIC | BIC | Persistence | Half-life (days) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GARCH(1,1) | 0.1041 | 0.8724 | — | 6925.13 | 6948.75 | 0.9764 | 29.07 |
| GJR-normal | 0.0286 | 0.8569 | 0.1481 | 6865.31 | 6894.83 | 0.9596 | 16.80 |
| GJR-t | ~0 (4.2e-18) | 0.8906 | 0.1370 | 6730.08 | 6765.50 | 0.9591 | 16.60 |
| GJR-skewed-t | ~0 (4.1e-14) | 0.8891 | 0.1423 | 6704.11 | 6745.44 | 0.9602 | 17.07 |

| Model | Ljung-Box p (lag 10) | ARCH-LM p |
|---|---|---|
| GARCH(1,1) | 0.517 | 0.414 |
| GJR-normal | 0.106 | 0.068 |
| GJR-t | 0.013 | 0.0063 |
| GJR-skewed-t | 0.0092 | 0.0043 |

  Printed Gamma p-values are all <0.001 in every GJR model's case (3.6e-4 for normal, 7.7e-7 for t, 1.5e-7 for skewed-t). Since all Gamma values are statistically significant, the presence of the leverage effect is confirmed. Furthermore, since Gamma is significant in all GJR models, evidently, no matter what residual distribution is modeled, the leverage effect exists. 

  Point to be noted here is that as Gamma is added to the variance equation half-life falls from roughly 29 days to roughly 17 days. This signals that half of the long-term modeled shock memory is actually asymmetry which is not considered by the GARCH (1,1) specification. Lastly shock persistence remains similar amongst all estimates.

  By AIC and BIC criteria, the best ranked model by likelihood is the GJR GARCH with residuals modeled with a skewed-t distribution while the GJR model with a student's t distribution is ranked second best by the aforementioned criteria. These results are expected as heavier tail distributions are known to improve likelihood estimations. Hence no surprising result is yielded.

  On the contrary, both GJR models modeled on a fat-tailed residual distribution both have an alpha of almost zero with the normal distribution GJR being the only GJR that has an interior alpha value. This happens as the optimizer in the rest of the two GJR models forces respective alphas to their closest non-zero values (non-negativity constraint) above the unconstrained optimum since the skewed-t and student's t distributions assign higher probability to extreme realizations/events. The GJR models have a parameter known as Eta which represents the degrees of freedom parameter controlling tail thickness and Lambda which is unique to the skewed-t distribution which is the skewness parameter. Here are the eta and lambda values for the skew-t distributed GJR along with their significance:

|Distribution|Parameter|Value|P-Value|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Skewed-T|Eta|7.366|4.88e-13|
|Skewed-T|Lambda|-0.149|6.37e-07|
|Student's T|Eta|6.940|6.128e-14|

  Since both Eta values and the Lambda value prove significant this confirms that the data obtained has fat tails and is negatively skewed. The distributional assumption of GJR models automatically assumes that extreme realized returns are more probable than what the plain GARCH model initially assumes hence fat-tail shock behavior that is otherwise to be captured by alpha in the variance equation is being absorbed by the GJR models.

  ## Conclusion
  The GJR models rank best by AIC and BIC as expected. However residual diagnostics conducted on the GJR models show worse results than residual diagnostics of even the plain GARCH model (control). P-values obtained for both the Student's t and skewed-t distributed models are below 0.05 which shows there are still remaining ARCH effects in the models, even though the null-hypothesis of no autocorrelation was expected to fail to be rejected. Since the Alpha obtained on these models is the boundary solution Alpha, the variance equation can not be expected to fully capture volatility. Hence, AIC/BIC metrics alone prove to be insufficient as selection criteria here.
  
  In light of all the metrics obtained, the **normally distributed** GJR GARCH model proves to be the best at capturing volatility due to three main causes:
  1. The Alpha parameter obtained here is interior and not boundary defined hence the volatility equation is not reliant on a boundary constrained parameter.
  2. The model has considerably lower AIC/BIC values than the control and better residual diagnostics results as compared to the fat-tailed variants which introduce instability.
  3. Gamma obtained is significant which means that the model is successful at capturing the leverage effect.


## Limitations

1. GJR variants are rejected in this scenario even though they have lower AIC/BIC values due to boundary alpha values seen which can affect calculated variance and reduce accuracy. This shows that models can not be ranked only based on AIC/BIC as likelihood selection criteria can qualify numerically inaccurate models only on the basis of better fit. Hence, as seen above, in certain scenarios distributional flexibility may result in a compromise of variance parameters in explanatory power.

2. Over the 11-year period economic and geopolitical regimes are assumed constant which is a likely cause of the ARCH effects not being fully captured and accounted for in the data.

3. Exogenous variables and their effect on volatility is not considered in the scope of this project hence reducing maximum predictive power and accuracy.

4. The persistence formula for the GJR models assumes symmetry in the context of occurence of negative and positive innovations which is statistically inaccurate as either innovation may weight out the other. The Lambda value obtained for the Skewed-t GJR model is statistically significant with a value of -0.149 which suggests that negative innovations are more probable than positive innovations. Hence Gamma contribution to persistence is slightly above than the assumed value of γ/2.

5. Out-of-Sample validation is yet to be carried out for this model, hence forecasting accuracy remains untested as of now.
